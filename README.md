FBBI
====

This is FBBI, the Flaming Bovine Befunge-98 Intepreter â€” the "first and
worst" of the [Funge-98](http://catseye.tc/node/Funge-98) interpreters available.

It's actually not so bad anymore, after a
[patch-applying and bug-killing session back in 2011](http://catseye.tc/node/OMG_WTF_FBBI_1.0_SIAS_EVVK!).
Still, it should probably not be your first choice for a Befunge-98 interpreter,
nor does it claim to be the reference implementation of the language.  It was
just an early one.
